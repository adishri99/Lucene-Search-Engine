## CS7IS3 First Assignment: Building a Lucene Search Engine.

**Aditya Kumar Shrivastava, TCD ID: 19323354.**

1. This project implements a search engine using Apache Lucene. 
2. We index and search documents from the cranfiled dataset using Lucene.
3. This search engine is evaluated using trec_eval.

## How to run the project:

**Step 1: Perform a maven clean**

	mvn clean

**Step 2: Download and Install dependencies** 

	mvn install

**Step 3: RunIndexerSearcher the program to index and execute searches on the the cranfield dataset.**

	mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="RunIndexerSearcher"


## Evaluating the search and query results using trex_eval:

Following the generating of the “**results_ashrivas.txt**” file which contains the results of searching on the cranfield dataset, please proceed to evaluate the results using trec_eval. 
**You may do so by running the following command**

	./trec_eval/trec_eval QRelsCorrectedforTRECeval results_ashrivas.txt

**Please note:**
1. trec_eval has been prebuilt and we do not need to run the ‘make’ command
2. QRelsCorrectedforTrecEval should be used when you are attempting the evaluate the search results generated by the program.
